WASHINGTON (AP) — With summer just around the corner, ice cream enthusiasts are gearing up for the hottest season of the year. And this year, there's a new frozen treat taking the ice cream world by storm.

Introducing: avocado ice cream.

While it may sound like an unusual combination, avocado ice cream is gaining popularity thanks to its creamy texture and subtle flavor. Made with ripe avocados, heavy cream, and a touch of sugar, this frozen dessert is both delicious and healthy.

According to nutrition experts, avocados are loaded with healthy fats and vitamins that can benefit your heart, skin, and overall health. And when combined with ice cream, they create a rich and velvety treat that's perfect for hot summer days.

But avocado ice cream isn't the only new trend in the ice cream world. Vegan ice cream is also making waves, with more and more people turning to plant-based options for health and ethical reasons.

Made with non-dairy milk such as almond or coconut milk, vegan ice cream is just as creamy and flavorful as its traditional counterpart. And with a wide range of flavors, from classic vanilla to exotic mango sorbet, there's something for everyone to enjoy.

But whether you prefer avocado ice cream or vegan ice cream, one thing's for sure: ice cream is the ultimate summer indulgence.

From the classic ice cream trucks that roam the streets to the trendy ice cream shops popping up in every city, there's no shortage of ways to enjoy this frozen treat. And with new flavors and innovations constantly emerging, the future of ice cream looks brighter than ever.

So grab a cone, a spoon, or a bowl and savor the sweet taste of summer with a scoop of your favorite ice cream. After all, life is short – why not treat yourself?

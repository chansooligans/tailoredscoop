NEW YORK - College students across the country are calling for a major overhaul of the higher education system, citing concerns over rising tuition costs, limited access to financial aid, and a lack of diversity and inclusion on campus.

In a survey conducted by the National Student Association, nearly 80% of college students said they believe that the cost of tuition is too high, and over 60% reported struggling to pay for their education. Additionally, 75% of students expressed concern over the lack of financial aid options available to them, citing long wait times and complicated application processes as major barriers.

"I feel like I'm drowning in debt before I've even started my career," said Sarah Johnson, a sophomore at a private university in the Midwest. "I'm constantly worried about how I'm going to afford my next semester, and it's impacting my mental health and my ability to focus on my studies."

In response to these concerns, student activists have launched a nationwide campaign to demand action from lawmakers and college administrators. The campaign, called #ChangeHigherEd, includes a series of protests, rallies, and social media initiatives aimed at raising awareness and pressuring decision-makers to take action.

One of the key demands of the campaign is for colleges and universities to increase funding for need-based financial aid and to simplify the application process. Activists argue that this would make higher education more accessible to low-income and marginalized communities and would help to reduce the burden of student debt.

"We need to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at a college education," said Samantha Lee, a junior at a public university in California and one of the leaders of the #ChangeHigherEd movement. "We can't keep letting wealthy students buy their way into top schools while others are left behind because they can't afford it."

The campaign has also called for greater transparency and accountability from colleges and universities, particularly in regards to their efforts to promote diversity and inclusion on campus. Activists have criticized many schools for failing to adequately address issues of racism, sexism, and homophobia, and have called for more robust diversity and sensitivity training programs for students and faculty.

"We need to create an environment where all students feel safe, valued, and respected," said Lee. "We can't allow discrimination and hate to fester on our campuses. It's up to us to demand change and hold our institutions accountable."

The #ChangeHigherEd campaign has already gained significant traction, with thousands of students across the country joining the movement and sharing their stories on social media. However, activists say that there is still much work to be done, and they are calling on all students, faculty, and community members to join the fight for a more equitable and just higher education system.

"We can't sit idly by while our futures are being determined by a broken system," said Johnson. "We need to stand up and demand change, and we need to do it now."
